# Bill Generator App using Go     

Bill Generator App is an application to generate the bill using Go programming language. This app will ask user to enter the bill name, add the items and price, add tips and calculate total amount to pay. After that, user can choose to save the bill, and this app will generate a txt file that represents the actual bill.     

If you are using Windows operating system, you can [download this zip file](https://github.com/muhduzairmf/bill-generator-app/releases/tag/v1.0) and extract it. The BillGenerator.exe is ready to use.        

If you are using MacOS or any Linux-based operating system, you still can use it by simply run and build the executable program. To do that, please make sure that you has installed the [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) compiler and extract [the binaries/source code of this app](https://github.com/muhduzairmf/bill-generator-app/releases/tag/v1.0). Then, open the terminal and type        

```Bash
    go build main.go bill.go
```

From this command, it will generate the executable program named 'main'. After that, you can delete the main.go and bill.go file. You can use this app by simply running the 'main' file.
